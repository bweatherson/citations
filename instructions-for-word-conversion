Best plan so far for getting into Word format

1. Export to epub
  Add to _output.yml a line "bookdown::epub_book: default"
2. Convert to docx via pandoc
  require(rmarkdown)
  pandoc_convert("<<filename>>.epub", to = "docx", output = "<<filename>>.docx")
  NOTE: This may require changing working directory
  Doesn't seem to work with file in subdirectory
3. In Word save as web page - this will put all graphics in a folder
4. Go back through file and replace each graphic with a reference to file list
  They *should* be in order
  And they *should* have captions saved still

NOTE

Haven't yet figured out how this handles citations
