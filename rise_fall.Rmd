# Growth and Decline

## Ways of measuring growth and decline

1. Mean year (what I've done so far)
2. Percentage after 2010
3. Ratio of last quarter/first quarter
4. Something else - feel there was a something else - maybe 

Should look at ways of comparing these

## Changes in Group 1

Sort of already covered, but briefly note the big movements

## Rises in Group 2

Lots of social

## Falls in Group 2

My favorite things

## Rises in Group 3

Often a bit random, one special issue

## Falls in Group 3

Again, says a bit about me
