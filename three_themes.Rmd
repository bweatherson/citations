# Three More Themes

## Ryle and Descartes

Lots of work that turns on the separability of the mind, and other Rylean themes

- Know How/Skill
- Perception
- Disagreement

## Senses of Reduction

- Supervenience to grounding
- Nagelian reduction to mechanisms
- Higher level causation

## Category Breakdown

- No gap between ethics/epistemology, really across board
- Hard to sort mind from epistemology in perception
- Huge overlap between mind/metaphysics/science
- And obviously all the social stuff
- This becomes less clear in group 3; they are sometimes small enough
- A different project would look at whether the philosophy/not-philosophy border also breaking down; would require more historical work to see how strong it was at different times.
