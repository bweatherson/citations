Missing Topics in Journals

No Know-How in Kant-Studien; fine
  Look to generalist journals
  
No Debunking Arguments in Phil Review out of 500+ articles; kind of surprising actually - thought it would be science
  12th biggest topic!!!
  OK, Phil Review doesn't publish much, bound to have weird things
  Also only 3.1 in Mind - this is a funny one
  Also only 3.4 in JPhil - what's going on
  
Hardly any Egalitarianism in Nous
  Only 1.7 out of the 680+ articles
  By articles it's 9th biggest!
  It's really 20th century political phil continuing on
  But hardly in Nous
  
PPR
  5.5 on egalitarianism (for total of 2.7 cites!)
  1.7 on models (and the 1 was misplaced)
  In general, PPR does very little science

Phil Studies
  Covers everything
  In part because if something is covered in Phil Studies, it's in this study
  But could have left stuff out; impressive that it didn't
  Should cross check this with looking at whole fields
  
Nothing in P&PA on Mechanisms
  This is arguably a bit disappointing
  
Epistemic Justice has less than 1 article in each of 
  JPhil
  PPR
  Nous
  Mind
  Phil Review
  Still really looking to get noticed (though maybe things are getting better post-2019)
  
Testimony, on other hand, does well in the big journals - 22 in PPR
