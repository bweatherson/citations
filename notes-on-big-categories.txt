Notes on some big categories

Exclusion problem has lots in philosophy of science because of themes of emergence and reduction
  These are good questions, independent of exclusion problem
  Big point is that bulk of citations goes to what I think is a non-problem; bulk of papers arguably does not

Chalmers Verbal Disputes does not go with Parthood - why not
  It connects to Sundell/Plunkett on disagreement and Jenkins on taste
  And these are tied much more tightly into relativism
  Hard to tease apart some of these categories!

Maybe I should do the connections one first - gets a better sense of where the boundaries are
